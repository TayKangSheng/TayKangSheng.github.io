  <h1>What do i do?</h1>
  <p>
    I am a software developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Officially, A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer">software developer</a> is a person concerned with facets of the software development process, including the research, design, programming, and testing of computer software. 
  </p>
  <p>
    But really? I love to help people using every bit of programming knowledge i have to make a difference. Be it just making a small microsite to bring fun and laughter, or be part of a large scale software development team to bring meaningful technology into the society. Which really means, anything works as long as i can make someone's life better.

  <p>
    Programming is always a learning process. I would love to learn more if you have something that you think would be cool to work on! Just drop me an <a href="mailto:kangsheng@gmail.com">email</a>!
